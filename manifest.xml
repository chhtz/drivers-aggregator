    <description brief="basic tools to manage sample streams">
        This library offers basic tools to manage sample streams. The
        SampleReader class for instance allows to reorder data samples and
        "wait" for acquisitions in which latency is non negligible.
        TimestampEstimator does a best-guess of a stream of samples that come at
        a fixed, unknown period.
